      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Privacy notice</h1>

      <p>GOV.UK (or www.gov.uk) is provided by the <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital Service</a> (<abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr>), part of the Cabinet Office.</p>

      <p>Cabinet Office is the data controller for pages starting with www.gov.uk - for example, <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://www.gov.uk/pip">www.gov.uk/pip</a>.</p>

      <p>If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be the data controller</li>
        <li>be responsible for processing any data you share with them</li>
        <li>publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
        <p>If you make a claim for Universal Credit <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk/postcode-checker" rel="external">www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk</a>, the Department for Work and Pensions will be the responsible controller. The service’s own <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" rel="external" href="https://www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk/privacypolicy">privacy notice</a> will apply.</p>
      </div>

      <p>A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed. For more information, read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053" rel="external">Data Protection Public Register</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect</h2>

      <p>The personal data we collect from you includes:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you contact GOV.UK</li>
        <li>your email address and subscription preferences when you sign up to our email alerts</li>
        <li>how you use our emails - for example whether you open them and which links you click on</li>
        <li>your Internet Protocol (<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>) address, and details of which version of <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://gov.uk/support/browsers">web browser</a> you used</li>
        <li>information on how you use the site, using <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://gov.uk/support/cookies">cookies</a> and page tagging techniques</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. This includes <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses. The data is anonymised before being used for analytics processing.</p>

      <p>Google Analytics processes anonymised information about:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the pages you visit on GOV.UK</li>
        <li>how long you spend on each GOV.UK page</li>
        <li>how you got to the site</li>
        <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not store your personal information through Google Analytics (for example your name or address).</p>

      <p>We will not identify you through analytics information, and we will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would identify who you are.</p>

      <p>We continuously test and monitor our data protection controls to make sure they’re effective and to detect any weaknesses.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why we need your data</h2>

      <p>We collect information through Google Analytics to see how you use the site and government digital services. We do this to help:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users</li>
        <li>make improvements, for example <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/26/new-tool-to-see-trending-searches" rel="external">improving site search</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>We also collect data in order to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>gather feedback to improve our services, for example our email alerts</li>
        <li>respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to</li>
        <li>send email alerts to users who request them</li>
        <li>allow you to access government services and make transactions</li>
        <li>provide you with information about local services</li>
        <li>monitor use of the site to identify security threats</li>

Data collected by Google Analytics data may be transferred outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> for processing.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

      <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data - for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.</p>
